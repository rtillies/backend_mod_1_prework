## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
```
  A hash is a collection of data arranged in key-value pairs.
  An array is an ordered linear structure.
```

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```
  pet_store = {puppies: 10, kittens: 20, hamsters: 30}
```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
```
  states["IA"]
```

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
```
  states.keys
  states.values
```

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
```
  Another example is student names and grades. Instead of the students in a
  specific order (array), they can be referred to by name.
  students = {Richard: 72.9, Courtney: 84.0, Seneca: 91.0}
```

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
```
  No questions at this time
