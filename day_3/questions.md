## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
```
  A conditional statement tests the truth of a statement and determines next
  steps. For example:
  - If it's raining, take an umbrella.
  - If you have more than $1, buy a candy bar.
  - If you cannot swim, do not go to the pool.
```

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
```
  To make a decision based on a specific condition.
```

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```
  if this
    do that
  end
```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
```
  if aaa
    do step1
  elsif bbb
    do step2
  ... # additional elsif statements here if needed
  else
    do step9
```

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
```
  if weather == 'sunny'
    p "sunscreen"
  elsif weather == 'rainy'
    p "umbrella"
  elsif weather == 'snowy'
    p "coat"
  else
    p "good to go!"
  end
```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
```
  Conditional statements can be used in loops
```
